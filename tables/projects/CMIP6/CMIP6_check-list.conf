# QA check-list(path: path/QA-DKRZ/tables/project/CMIP6/CMIP6_check-list.conf)

#   Description:
#   Any text following the # char is a comment.
#   Each deteced incident is handled by a directive on its own.
#   Directives are specified by tokens within groups indicated by braces {}.
#
#  Brace Operation:
#  A nested brace inherits the contents of the one it is embedded. The
#  hierarchy of braces is tree-like with unlimited number of parallel
#  branches as well as vertical branching. Thus, the tip of a branch
#  inherits every item from the parent down the crotches to the root.
#  The braces {} of the lowest level may be omitted as well as a comma around braces.
#  Each higher-level branch, i.e. contents of a brace,
#  is a specialisation to its parent. A brace may contain multiple
#  comma-separated items. If word 'key[value]' of a higher level replaces
#  'key=value2' a lower level one. Inheritance of an item may also be
#  inhibited by the macro "D(item).
#  The hierarchy of braces is eventually expanded into unrelated strings.
#  Example:
#     simple:  given: a,{b,c},{d,e},f
#             result: 'a,f', 'a,b,c,f', 'a,d,e,f'
#  elaborate: given:  a,{b,c,f=5{D(c), b=2,f}},{d},e
#             result: 'a,e', 'a,b,c,f=5,e', 'a,b=2,f,e', 'a,d,e'

#   Key words: L1, L2, L3, D, EM, flag, var, V=value, R=record
#   Level:    L1 Notify incidents. Continue unrestricted.
#                The default for omitted level of severeness.
#             L2 Continue checking to the end of the file. Then, lock processing of the current variable.
#             L3 Stop after completion of meta-data checks. Lock processing of current variable.
#             L4 Stop immediately and shutdown the QA session (no locks).
#   Flag:     Must match in the QA.cpp class.
#   Task:     Email notification (EM), discard the check/test (D)
#   Variable: A list of comma-separated acronyms of variables to which directives
#             are applied; every variable by default.
#   Value:    Constraining value, e.g. {flag,D,V=0,var} discards a test for variable var only if value=0
#   Record:   Record(s), i.e. data at a time value, may be excluded from checking. Single records
#             as well as ranges, e.g. 1-12, may be provided.
#             Note: counting of records starts with number one.

# NOTE_ALWAYS {L1}, {10,D}

#   Leading characters permitted for flags (besides a digit).
  PERMITTED_FLAG_BEGIN=R
